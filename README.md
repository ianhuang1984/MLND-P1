# MLND-P1
The project is dedicated to prediciting housing prices in Boston.

Project covers the following:
- Data Exploration: Obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset.
- Preprocessing and Performance Metric Selection: Split the data into testing and training subsets and determine a suitable performance metric for the problem. Analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. 
- Model Selection: Pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Test the optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to previously found statistics.
